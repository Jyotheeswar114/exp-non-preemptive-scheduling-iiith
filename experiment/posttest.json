        "a": "fixed,preemptive",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Round robin seems to be fair as every process gets an equal share of CPU.",
        "b": "neither is true",
        "c": "while it is fixed it is not non preemptive",

      "question": "The main drawback of FCFS algorithm is ____ and is implemented by using ____ queue",
      "answers": {
        "a": "process starvation,FILO",
        "b": "wait time,FIFO",
        "c": "wait time,FILO",
        "d": "overload on CPU,FIFO"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "its biggest draw back is wait time causing a convoy effect and follows FIFO",
        "b": "its biggest draw back is wait time causing a convoy effect and does follow FIFO queue,FIFO stands for First in First Out and this is what is used in FCFS algorithm.",
        "c": "its biggest draw back is wait time causing a convoy effect and follows FIFO queue",
        "d": "its biggest draw back is wait time causing a convoy effect but FIFO is correct"
